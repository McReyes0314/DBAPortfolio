        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>In this activity, we have been tasked with designing a database table and identifying the most appropriate SQL commands. Below are the detailed instructions given to us:</p>
        <h4>Question 1</h4>
        <p>Design a database table for managing library books. include the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Columns: book_id (Primary Key, Integer), title (VARCHAR(100)), author (VARCHAR(50)),
                published_year (YEAR), genre (VARCHAR(30)), copies_available (Integer).
            </li>
            <li>Write the SQL statement to creare the table.</li>
            <li>
                Write an SQL query to insert the following book details into the table:<br>
                Book ID: 101, Title: "SQL Fundamentals", Author: "John Doe", Published Year: 2022,
                Genre: "Technology", Copies Available: 5.
            </li>
            <li>Write an SQL query to update the copies_available for the book with ID 101 to 7.</li>
            <li>Write an SQL query to delete all books published before 2000.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Question 2</h4>
        <p>For each scenario below, identify the most appropriate SQL command (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, SELECT,
            INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, GRANT, REVOKE) and provide a brief justification for your choice.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You need to create a new table in the database to store employee records</li>
            <li>A column in the "student" table needs to hava a default value updated</li>
            <li>You want to delete all records from the "products" table but keep the table structure.</li>
            <li>A user needs permission to view and query the the "sales" table</li>
            <li>You need to remove the "inventory" table entirely from the database</li>
        </ul>
